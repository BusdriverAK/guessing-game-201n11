  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I was born and raised in Fairbanks, Alaska. With long winters and small cities my life quickly started to revolve around technology, video games, and skiing. However, extreme temperatures and very little day light meant I spent less time on the slopes and more time building computers and playing games.</p>
  <p>After 5 years as a mechanic in the Navy, I shifted focus back to technology. I picked up a background in IT and coding, with plans to become a game developer.</p>
